<b>What if we use design to permeate the boundaries between humans and non-humans?</b>

We live in a world where fast changes make the future ever more uncertain. Therefore, design must be used not just for human purposes but for other living beings, too.

My research introduces data as a system of inter-species exchange of information. Translating data from the model used by one system into the pattern required by another, I want to encourage science discussions with non-scientists, raising humans' understanding of the natural world.

<b>What if we use data to reshape ecosystems evolution?</b>

<b><i>Autumn Season</b></i> visualises and collects daily climate data from a weather API. The intention is to recreate the Matsutake mushroom ecosystem through the three primary variables affecting his growth: temperature, humidity and precipitation. <br>
Two sections define the project:<br>
[1] an immersive digital environment that visualises the climate data over Baoshan in real-time,<br>
[2] a long-term database that will store the forecast data over days in the Chinese city.

Three main phases define this project:<br>
[1] archive (<i>ongoing</i>)<br>
[2] analysis<br>
[3] simulation<br>

The aim is to collect weather data from speculating, analysing and predicting the fungi evolution in responses to current and future environmental changes.
