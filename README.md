# Autumn Season

<b>What if we use design to permeate the boundaries between humans and non-humans?</b>

We live in a world where fast changes make the future ever more uncertain. Design must be used not just for human purposes but for other living beings, too. 

My research introduces data as a system of interspecies exchange of information. Translating data from the model used by one system into the pattern required by another, I want to encourage science discussions to non-scientists, raising humans' understanding of a bigger world surrounding us, the natural one.

<b>What if we use data to reshape ecosystems evolution?</b>

"Autumn season" visualises and collect daily climate data from a weather API. The intention is to recreate the Matsutakes' mushroom ecosystem through the three primary variables affecting his growth: temperature, humidity and precipitation. <br>
Two sections define the project:<br>
[1] an immersive digital environment that visualises the climate data over Baoshan in real-time<br>
[2] a long-term dataset that will store the forecast data over days in the Chinese city.

Three main phases define this project:<br>
[1] archive (ongoing)<br>
[2] analysis<br>
[3] simulation<br>

The aim is to collect a large amount of data from speculating, analysing and predicting the fungi evolution in responses to current and future environmental changes.
